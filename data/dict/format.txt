At most four fields, separated by several spaces:

[accent] [kana] [kanji] [romaji] [chinese]

The kanji field will always be surrounded by '[' & ']'
The romaji field will always be surrounded by '<' & '>'

The romaji field is only used for 'skewed' pronunciation, e.g.
'„ÅØ' pronounced as 'wa' in the middle of sentence.
